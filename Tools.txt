Method 1.: For Comcast IP lookups you can tell the agent to use the Grandslam (No longer used by comcast; Main tool is Einstein now.) tool which has a search box labeled "IP Address" and have them type the IP into that and it will return all the details on the customer. This method has been patched as of january 2014 the "IP Address" search box has been greyed out!(Patched)
Method 2.: For Comcast IP lookups you can tell the agent to use the Grandslam (No longer used by comcast; Main tool is Einstein now.) tool which has a search box labeled "DNS Lookup" under the greyed out IP Address box which can also pull accounts up by the IP Address, so just tell the agent to type the IP Address in it and the account results should show up! Normally this search was made for DNS related comcast IPS like this one for example:69.252.250.103, which have the hostname dns101.comcast.net but it seems to also pull up CPE(Customer Premise Equipment) IP's as well, so this looks like a bad implementation error on their end.
Method 3.: For Comcast IP lookups you can tell the agent to use the Comtrac tool which has a search box labeled "IPV4" which can pull up the customers account details after the agent types the IP address in it so the results should show up.
Method 4.: For Comcast IP lookups you can tell the agent to use the Einstein tool which has a search box labeled "DNS Lookup" which can pull up accounts by the IP Address and it will return the full account results.
Method 5.: For Comcast IP lookups you can tell the agent to transfer you to the Network Solutions department and the IP Address search field on their Grandslam (No longer used by comcast; Main tool is Einstein now.)s aren't grayed out and you can do IP searches.

====Law Enforcement Impersonation (Subpeona Method)====
The second way to ISP dox someone is to fake a cop or federal agency of law enforcement to gather information attached to an IP Address.This method is notoriously used by the blackhat hacker killerpop89 before he got owned by cosmo and the rest of ugnazi.Unlike
employee impersonation this method is a wee bit harder but it is possible. First you want to find the subpoeona compliance line or similiar law enforcement helpline which I will provide all the contact information below for all the common ISP's.Sometimes if you can't social engineer the legal department fully they may keep asking you to send in a subpeona which you can photoshop a legit looking one and to send it in you can use a service like efax (efax.com).After all that is done you should get the information sent to you over phone or over email.
Hello, I am Robert Traviano. I work for Law Enforcement as I have a subpoena letter - http://prntscr.com/6fuvcq That's a screenshot of the subpoena letter. So I need you to provide information from this IP address - 67.186.175.38 - It is HIGHLY urgent.
If they don't give you information or refuse to, try this:
<Employee name>, this is officially unresolved case. FBI are working on this and I am one of them, please look at the subpoena letter. We believe the person of that IP Address is a criminal due to illegal activites online. It is HIGHLY urgent. You could be saving people lives if you help out.
TL;DR:
1) Draft up a fake subpoena for the IP adress you're targeting
2) send the subpoena into the ISP for the IP adress
3) call legal department after hours, you will be transferred to general support
4) tell general support you're calling RE: subpoena and tell them you need the information ASAP.
5) They will happily disclose anything you want to know regarding the account

Call 1800-TWCABLE. Enter in a phone number and zip in the area of the IP address. Once an agent picks up tell them a fake name, you work for TWC internet tech support, and you were having trouble looking up a customers account with AAD. Then ask them if they can transfer you to tier 3. They will transfer you then. Once you get transferred to tier 3 say your name and your work for TWC internet tech support. Tell them you were having trouble pulling up an account by IP address. Say that Unified was giving you an error not found. Tell them you don’t have DOCSIS and ask them if they can look up the account in that. They should do it, so give them the IP. Once they pull up the account ask for these things in the order listed:
-Name
-Phone
-Address
-MAC Address
-User ID
-Email
-Account Number
After this point if you ask for anything else they may get suspicious. They may give it to you, or you might have to call back. Try asking for this information on the account.
-Security measure: Last 4 of the ssn and/or the 4 digit pin code
-customer code
-full driver license
After you get that call back TWC and ask to reset your password. Say you forgot the SQA. They will ask for the security measure and customer code then they’ll reset it.
You’ll want access into the primary email and the MyServices feature.
Make sure you get both reset, but sometimes you’ll have to create the MyServices account.
Also if you want the SSID and network password go to the WiFi live chat once logged into the target’s account. The agents will ask for some information in order to verify you then they’ll ask for the modem MAC address. Give them the MAC address the employee read out to you earlier when you asked them for the MAC address on file. They should then provide you with the SSID name and password.

Password Reset: http://pt.rr.com/
Tools:
AAD - Used to pull up the account once they have the information on the customer.
Unified - Pulls up by MAC, IP, etc.
ATG Tools / DOCSIS - Basically TWC’s “master tool”. Can do just about anything.
If you’re ever asked for an employee ID just use this. It’s legitimate.

Method 2.: For Comcast IP lookups you can tell the agent to use the Grandslam (No longer used by comcast; Main tool is Einstein now.) tool which has a search box labeled "DNS Lookup" under the greyed out IP Address box which can also pull accounts up by the IP Address, so just tell the agent to type the IP Address in it and the account results should show up! Normally this search was made for DNS related comcast IPS like this one for example:69.252.250.103, which have the hostname dns101.comcast.net but it seems to also pull up CPE(Customer Premise Equipment) IP's as well, so this looks like a bad implementation error on their end.
Method 3.: For Comcast IP lookups you can tell the agent to use the Comtrac tool which has a search box labeled "IPV4" which can pull up the customers account details after the agent types the IP address in it so the results should show up.
Method 4.: For Comcast IP lookups you can tell the agent to use the Einstein tool which has a search box labeled "DNS Lookup" which can pull up accounts by the IP Address and it will return the full account results.
Method 5.: For Comcast IP lookups you can tell the agent to transfer you to the Network Solutions department and the IP Address search field on their Grandslam (No longer used by comcast; Main tool is Einstein now.)s aren't grayed out and you can do IP searches.

====Law Enforcement Impersonation (Subpeona Method)====
The second way to ISP dox someone is to fake a cop or federal agency of law enforcement to gather information attached to an IP Address.This method is notoriously used by the blackhat hacker killerpop89 before he got owned by cosmo and the rest of ugnazi.Unlike
employee impersonation this method is a wee bit harder but it is possible.First you want to find the subpoeona compliance line or similiar law enforcement helpline which I will provide all the contact information below for all the common ISP's.Sometimes if you can't social engineer the legal department fully they may keep asking you to send in a subpeona which you can photoshop a legit looking one and to send it in you can use a service like efax (efax.com).After all that is done you should get the information sent to you over phone or over email.
TL;DR:
1) Draft up a fake subpoena for the IP adress you're targeting
2) send the subpoena into the ISP for the IP adress
3) call legal department after hours, you will be transferred to general support
4) tell general support you're calling RE: subpoena and tell them you need the information ASAP.
5) They will happily disclose anything you want to know regarding the account
